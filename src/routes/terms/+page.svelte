	<p>
		By using our products and services, you agree to these terms.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Intended use</h2>
	<p>
		Our products are designed for lawful home security monitoring on property you own or have explicit permission to
		monitor. You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws regarding surveillance, recording, and

		prohibited and may result in criminal liability.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Data security and transmission</h2>
	<p>
		While we implement end-to-end encryption and security measures to protect your data, no method of electronic
		transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the
		internet or stored on devices. You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of electronic data transmission and
		storage.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Liability limitations</h2>
	<p>
		To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages arising from product malfunction, data
		breaches, unauthorized access, lost footage, service interruptions, or failure to detect or record events. Our
		products are tools to assist with security monitoring but do not guarantee prevention of theft, damage, or harm.
		You remain solely responsible for your property security.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Product warranty</h2>
	<p>
		Our warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for the period specified with your
		product. The warranty does not cover damage from misuse, abuse, accidents, drops, liquid exposure, unauthorized
		modifications, or use outside specified operating conditions. Warranty claims require proof of purchase and are
		subject to our inspection and approval.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Service availability</h2>
	<p>
		We strive to maintain reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. We may modify, suspend,

		connectivity issues, third-party services, or circumstances beyond our control.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">User responsibilities</h2>
	<p>
		You are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials and keys, ensuring proper product
		installation and configuration, maintaining adequate internet connectivity, and keeping firmware updated. Failure
		to follow installation guidelines or security recommendations may void warranties or limit our liability.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Prohibited activities</h2>
	<p>
		You may not use products for illegal surveillance or harassment, interfere with other users' service access,
		impersonate us or our services, or resell our hardware products as new after use. Modification of open-source
		software is permitted under its license terms, but any modifications are made at your own risk and may void
		hardware warranties.
	</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h2 class="mb-4">Changes to terms</h2>
