		<h1 class="text-4xl">Terms of Use</h1>
		<br />
		<p>By using our products and services, you agree to these terms.</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Intended use</h2>
		<p>
			Our products are designed for lawful home security monitoring on property you own or have explicit permission to
			monitor. You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws regarding surveillance, recording, and
			privacy in your jurisdiction. Use of our products to unlawfully monitor, record, or surveil others is strictly
			prohibited and may result in criminal liability.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Safety warnings</h2>
		<p>
			Cables included with our products should be kept out of reach of children due to strangulation risk. Do not use
			products with damaged, frayed, or exposed cables — these pose a fire and electric shock hazard and should be
			replaced immediately. Damage caused by power surges or lightning strikes is not covered under warranty, and the
			use of surge protectors is recommended.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			Improper installation may result in the device falling, potentially causing injury or property damage — follow
			all installation guidelines and ensure secure mounting.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			Our products use infrared LEDs for night vision which may cause interference with other infrared-sensitive
			devices or equipment in the vicinity. Some of our products may contain small parts — keep packaging and
			components away from young children to avoid choking hazards.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Data security and transmission</h2>
		<p>
			While we implement end-to-end encryption and security measures to protect your data, no method of electronic
			transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the
			internet or stored on devices. You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of electronic data transmission and
			storage.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Liability limitations</h2>
		<p>
			To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages arising from product malfunction, data
			breaches, unauthorized access, lost footage, service interruptions, or failure to detect or record events. Our
			products are tools to assist with security monitoring but do not guarantee prevention of theft, damage, or harm.
			You remain solely responsible for your property security.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Product warranty</h2>
		<p>
			Our warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for the period specified with your
			product. The warranty does not cover damage from misuse, abuse, accidents, drops, liquid exposure, unauthorized
			modifications, use in environments exceeding 60°C, or use outside specified operating conditions. For products not
			explicitly labeled as outdoor-rated,
			water and moisture damage is not covered under warranty. Warranty claims require proof of purchase and are
			subject to our inspection and approval.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Service availability</h2>
		<p>
			We strive to maintain reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. We may modify, suspend, or
			discontinue features or services at any time. We are not responsible for outages caused by internet connectivity
			issues, third-party services, or circumstances beyond our control.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">User responsibilities</h2>
		<p>
			You are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials and keys, ensuring proper product
			installation and configuration, maintaining adequate internet connectivity, and keeping firmware updated. Failure
			to follow installation guidelines or security recommendations may void warranties or limit our liability.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Prohibited activities</h2>
		<p>
			You may not use products for illegal surveillance or harassment, interfere with other users' service access,
			impersonate us or our services, or resell our hardware products as new after use. Modification of open-source
			software is permitted under its license terms, but any modifications are made at your own risk and may void
			hardware warranties.
		</p>
		<br /><br />

		<h2 class="mb-4 font-mono">Changes to terms</h2>
		<p>
			We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of our products after changes constitutes acceptance of
			updated terms.
		</p>
